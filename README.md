Sinus skate shop is an online webshop based on a design specification made in Figma. On the website you can browse through products, add to the shopping cart and complete a purchase. The site has different user modes, anonymous, logged in, and admin.
As a logged-in customer, you can see your order history. As an admin, you can see all completed orders, edit, delete products, etc.
The working method we worked with was Scrumban, a mix between Scrum and Kanban.
The tools used during this project were Vue.js, Vuex, Vue Router JS, CSS, Axios, REST, and WebAPI.
